A big shoutout to Gregg Vecchione, one of our Treetops Neighbors.

Gregg did a fantastic job installing cabinets in our laundry room. The vendor had actually measured incorrectly and Gregg had to cut one of the cabinets to fit. You'd never know. The result is perfect.

He did a few other things while he was here. We definitely recommend him, as he was professional, knowledgeable and thorough.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED HANDYMAN. Trudy and Ken Rozas highly recommend Gregg Vecchione, a Treetops resident, and a great home improvement handyman. Gregg, transformed our porch with the EZE BREEZE system into an extension of our home living area.
